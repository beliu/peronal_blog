                <p class="article-text">
                    The ennui of sitting through countless hours of kids' "entertainment" is comething all parents must
                    accept.
                    My parents tell me that when I was a wee toddler myself, I would watch this cheaply-produced
                    and simplisitic sing-along show on some channel that is now long gone. According to them, I loved it
                    and
                    they drank wine while waiting for the show to end (hope that "drinking in front of your toddler"
                    part was a joke, mom and dad).
                    That show in essence finds its spiritual successor in <em>Little Baby Bum</em>. Of course when we
                    were kids, all
                    shows were about half-an-hour long and could only be seen on TV at certain hours. Today's kids have
                    the great fortune of
                    being able to watch hours of content, on-demand, on YouTube. What that means is modern-day parents
                    have to not only
                    sit through these shows for much longer, and at anytime of the day, it also means we have to engage
                    in a daily battle
                    to limit our kids' screentime. Tell your parents that this generation of parents do in fact have a
                    harder job than they did,
                    regardless of whatever "modern conveneiences" they argue that we enjoy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Alright, let's focus on the show. If you are a fully-grown adult, then this show will bore you. It
                    mostly consists of CG animated
                    music videos for classic nurser rhymes such as "Hickery Dickery Dock" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little
                    Star". But obviously, this isn't
                    about you is it? I started to let my 2-year-old watch this before he could even speak a single
                    intelligble syllable. Within a month,
                    he started to sing along to "ABC" and "Shapes Train". This show was teaching him things! I began to
                    enjoy watching the show just to
                    hear him garble out words like square and orange. So a little mind-numbing? Yes. Educational?
                    Definitely. And that's really more
                    important. I will say that it is apparent many parents think the same way because the YouTube
                    channel behind the show has amassed
                    millions of subscribers. That must have opened the cash spigot because sometime two years ago, I
                    noticed a dramatic improvement
                    in animation quality. The characters started to look professionaly done, and not like they were
                    drawn by an art student trying
                    to learn how to use the animation software in order to fit multiple ovals together to form a face.
                    They also extended beyond
                    familiar nursery rhymes into original songs. Most of them are misses, especially the hip-hop
                    inspired ones. However, I must
                    admit that a few of them are quite catchy. One song in particular about connecting the dots uses a
                    punk-rock motif that is
                    an ear-worm, even if you aren't sure what is so punk about connecting dots.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you have a 2 or 3-year-old that can't follow even simple plotlines yet, then give <em>Little Baby
                        Bum</em> a try. There are quite
                    a few channels on YouTube that do the same thing, but I found the variety of songs on this channel
                    to be the greatest. The singers
                    have nice voices, and you may be surprised to learn that some song channels feature below-average
                    singers. The animation improves over time.
                    Besides all those maybe-technical aspects, the show is charming, with its own recurring cast. It's a
                    totally safe-for-kids channel and it will
                    help your child learn to speak and sing. And that's when you break out your camera and record
                    several dozen gigabytes of video, because
                    that's what modern-day parenting is all about.

                Hi, I'm Miranda. I'm a fashion designer for Imomom, a children's apparel firm.
                I went to school at the San Francisco Academy of Art. When I'm
                not working on the latest and cutest styles for kids wear, I am
                dealing with my <strike>out-of-control</strike> lovely son. Writing
                about all the shows he watches gives me clarity of mind when
                deciding which shows are the best for him.
